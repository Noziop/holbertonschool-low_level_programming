# C - Variables, if, else, while

This project is part of the Holberton School low-level programming track. It focuses on the basics of C programming, including variables, conditionals, and loops.

## Description

In this project, we explore fundamental concepts of C programming:
- Variables and data types
- If-else statements
- While loops
- ASCII character set
- Logical and relational operators

## Files

* `0-positive_or_negative.c`: Program that determines if a random number is positive, negative, or zero.
* `1-last_digit.c`: Program that prints the last digit of a random number.
* `2-print_alphabet.c`: Program that prints the alphabet in lowercase.
* `3-print_alphabets.c`: Program that prints the alphabet in lowercase, then in uppercase.
* `4-print_alphabt.c`: Program that prints the alphabet in lowercase, except 'q' and 'e'.
* `5-print_numbers.c`: Program that prints all single digit numbers of base 10.
* `6-print_numberz.c`: Program that prints all single digit numbers of base 10 using putchar.
* `7-print_tebahpla.c`: Program that prints the lowercase alphabet in reverse.
* `8-print_base16.c`: Program that prints all the numbers of base 16 in lowercase.
* `9-print_comb.c`: Program that prints all possible combinations of single-digit numbers.
* `100-print_comb3.c`: Program that prints all possible different combinations of two digits.
* `101-print_comb4.c`: Program that prints all possible different combinations of three digits.
* `102-print_comb5.c`: Program that prints all possible combinations of two two-digit numbers.

## Requirements

* Programs will be compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using gcc with the options -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89
* All files should end with a new line
* Code should use the Betty style
* No global variables allowed
* No more than 5 functions per file
* Only allowed C standard library functions are malloc, free and exit
* Allowed to use _putchar

## Compilation

To compile the C programs, use:

gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89 <filename.c> -o <output_name>

## Usage

After compilation, run the program:

./<output_name>
