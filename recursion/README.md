# C - Recursion

This project is part of the Holberton School low-level programming track. It focuses on the concept of recursion in C programming.

## Description

In this project, we explore:
- What recursion is and how to use it
- In which situations you should implement recursion
- In which situations you shouldn't implement recursion

## Files

* `main.h`: Header file containing function prototypes.
* `0-puts_recursion.c`: Function that prints a string, followed by a new line.
* `1-print_rev_recursion.c`: Function that prints a string in reverse.
* `2-strlen_recursion.c`: Function that returns the length of a string.
* `3-factorial.c`: Function that returns the factorial of a given number.
* `4-pow_recursion.c`: Function that returns the value of x raised to the power of y.
* `5-sqrt_recursion.c`: Function that returns the natural square root of a number.
* `6-is_prime_number.c`: Function that returns 1 if the input integer is a prime number, otherwise return 0.
* `100-is_palindrome.c`: Function that returns 1 if a string is a palindrome and 0 if not.
* `101-wildcmp.c`: Function that compares two strings and returns 1 if the strings can be considered identical, otherwise return 0.

## Requirements

* Programs will be compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using gcc with the options -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89
* All files should end with a new line
* Code should use the Betty style
* You are not allowed to use global variables
* No more than 5 functions per file
* You are not allowed to use the standard library. Any use of functions like printf, puts, etcâ€¦ is forbidden
* You are allowed to use _putchar
* The prototypes of all your functions and the prototype of the function _putchar should be included in your header file called main.h
* You are not allowed to use any kind of loops
* You are not allowed to use static variables

## Compilation

To compile the C programs, use:

gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89 *.c -o <output_name>

## Usage

After compilation, run the program:

./<output_name>
