# C - Structures, typedef

This directory contains C programs that demonstrate the usage of structures and typedef in C programming, as part of the Holberton School low-level programming curriculum.

## Description

In this project, we explore the concepts of structures and typedef in C. Structures allow us to group related variables under one name, while typedef is used to create aliases for data types, making the code more readable and maintainable.

## Files

- `dog.h`: Header file containing the definition of a new type `struct dog`.
- `1-init_dog.c`: Function that initializes a variable of type `struct dog`.
- `2-print_dog.c`: Function that prints a `struct dog`.
- `4-new_dog.c`: Function that creates a new dog.
- `5-free_dog.c`: Function that frees dogs.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this project, you should be able to:

- Understand what structures are and when, why, and how to use them
- Learn how to use `typedef`
- Implement functions that work with structures
- Create and manipulate custom data types

## Requirements

- All files are compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using gcc, with the options -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89
- Code follows the Betty style
- No global variables are allowed
- No more than 5 functions per file
- The only C standard library functions allowed are printf, malloc, free and exit
- All header files should be include guarded

## Usage

To compile the C files, use:

gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89 *.c -o [output_filename]
