# C - More functions, more nested loops

This project is part of the Holberton School low-level programming track. It builds upon the previous project on functions and nested loops, introducing more complex concepts and challenges.

## Description

In this project, we delve deeper into:
- Nested loops and how to use them
- Functions and how to use them
- The difference between a declaration and a definition of a function
- Function prototypes
- Scope of variables
- gcc flags (-Wall -Werror -pedantic -Wextra -std=gnu89)
- Header files and how to use them with #include

## Files

* `main.h`: Header file containing function prototypes.
* `0-isupper.c`: Function that checks for uppercase character.
* `1-isdigit.c`: Function that checks for a digit (0 through 9).
* `2-mul.c`: Function that multiplies two integers.
* `3-print_numbers.c`: Function that prints the numbers, from 0 to 9.
* `4-print_most_numbers.c`: Function that prints the numbers, from 0 to 9, except 2 and 4.
* `5-more_numbers.c`: Function that prints 10 times the numbers, from 0 to 14.
* `6-print_line.c`: Function that draws a straight line in the terminal.
* `7-print_diagonal.c`: Function that draws a diagonal line in the terminal.
* `8-print_square.c`: Function that prints a square.
* `9-fizz_buzz.c`: Program that prints the numbers from 1 to 100, but for multiples of 3 prints Fizz and for multiples of 5 prints Buzz.
* `10-print_triangle.c`: Function that prints a triangle.

## Requirements

* Programs and functions will be compiled with gcc 4.8.4 using the flags -Wall -Werror -Wextra and -pedantic
* All files should end with a new line
* Code should use the Betty style
* You are not allowed to use global variables
* No more than 5 functions per file
* You are not allowed to use the standard library. Any use of functions like printf, puts, etcâ€¦ is forbidden
* You are allowed to use _putchar
* The prototypes of all your functions and the prototype of the function _putchar should be included in your header file called main.h

## Compilation

To compile the C programs, use:

gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89 *.c -o <output_name>

## Usage

After compilation, run the program:

./<output_name>
