# C - argc, argv

This project is part of the Holberton School low-level programming track. It focuses on command-line arguments in C programming, specifically the use of `argc` and `argv`.

## Description

In this project, we explore:
- How to use arguments passed to your program
- The two prototypes of `main` and when to use each
- How to use `__attribute__((unused))` or `(void)` to compile functions with unused variables or parameters

## Files

* `main.h`: Header file containing function prototypes.
* `0-whatsmyname.c`: Program that prints its name, followed by a new line.
* `1-args.c`: Program that prints the number of arguments passed into it.
* `2-args.c`: Program that prints all arguments it receives.
* `3-mul.c`: Program that multiplies two numbers.
* `4-add.c`: Program that adds positive numbers.

## Requirements and Limitations

* Programs will be compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using gcc with the options -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89
* All files should end with a new line
* Code should use the Betty style
* You are not allowed to use global variables
* No more than 5 functions per file
* The prototypes of all your functions and the prototype of the function _putchar should be included in your header file called main.h
* You are allowed to use the standard library

## Compilation

To compile the C programs, use:

gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89 *.c -o <output_name>

## Usage

After compilation, run the program:

./<output_name> [arguments]
