# C - malloc, free

This directory contains C programs that demonstrate the usage of dynamic memory allocation using `malloc` and `free` functions.

## Description

The `malloc` and `free` functions are essential for dynamic memory management in C programming. This project explores their usage and implementation.

- `malloc`: Allocates a specified amount of memory during runtime.
- `free`: Deallocates the previously allocated memory.

## Files

[List of C files in this directory with brief descriptions]

## Learning Objectives

- Understand the concept of dynamic memory allocation
- Learn how to use `malloc` and `free`
- Practice allocating and freeing memory in C programs
- Understand the importance of freeing allocated memory to prevent memory leaks

## Requirements

- All files are compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using gcc, with the options -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89
- Code follows the Betty style

## Usage

To compile the C files, use:

gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89 *.c -o [output_filename]
