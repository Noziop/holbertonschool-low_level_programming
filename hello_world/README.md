# C - Hello, World

This project is an introduction to C programming and basic compilation concepts. It is part of the low-level programming curriculum at Holberton School.

## Description

In this project, we explore the fundamentals of C programming, including:
- Using the gcc compiler
- C program entry points with the `main` function
- Printing text using `printf`, `puts`, and `write`
- Manipulating standard error output
- Compiling and assembling C code

## Files

* `0-preprocessor`: Bash script that runs a C file through the preprocessor and saves the result.
* `1-compiler`: Bash script that compiles a C file without linking.
* `2-assembler`: Bash script that generates the assembly code of a C file.
* `3-name`: Bash script that compiles a C file and creates an executable named `cisfun`.
* `4-puts.c`: C program that prints a line using the `puts` function.
* `5-printf.c`: C program that prints a line using the `printf` function.
* `6-size.c`: C program that prints the size of various data types.
* `100-intel`: Script that generates Intel syntax assembly code from a C file.
* `101-quote.c`: C program that prints a line to the standard error.

## Requirements

* Programs and scripts will be compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using gcc.
* All files should end with a new line.
* A README.md file must be present at the root of the project folder.
* All Bash scripts must be executable.
* C programs should follow the Betty style.

## Compilation

To compile the C programs, use:

gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic <filename.c> -o <output_name>
